## Android

| Language or Technology  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Java-AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio)  |  You write Android apps in the Java programming language using an IDE called Android Studio. Based on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software, Android Studio is an IDE designed specifically for Android development. The fastest developer tools for building market-leading apps and accelerating performance. Android Studio will help you develop your app in a more productive way at scale. Build rich experiences. Code with confidence. Create connected apps. Eliminate tiresome tasks.  |
| [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) | Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. |
| [C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) | C++ can be used for Android App Development using the Android Native Development Kit(NDK). However, an app cannot be created totally using C++ and the NDK is used to implement parts of the app in C++ native code. This helps in using C++ code libraries for the app as required. While C++ is useful for Android App Development in some cases, it is much more difficult to set up and is much less flexible. It may also lead to more bugs because of the increased complexity. So, it is better to use Java as compared to C++ as it does not provide enough gain to offset the efforts required. |
| [Python](https://www.appdevelopmentpros.com)| Python is a growing high-level android app development software that is used in android app development. Python offers various tools that convert Python applications into packages for Android that support android mobile phones or other android devices. It is an object-oriented language and offers options like dynamic binding and dynamic typing that makes it an attractive language for Android app development. Python is much easier than other languages allowing developers to read and translate code reducing the time to develop an app. It also reduces the program maintenance and development cost. Python language can be used to build simple applications to large commercial system applications giving the best functionality to the app development platform.|


## IOS

| Language or Technology  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[Swift]( https://swift.org/)  | iOS developers design and build applications for mobile devices running Apple's iOS operating software. They are responsible for designing and coding the base application, ensuring the quality of the application, fixing application bugs, maintaining the code, and implementing application updates. As a Swift Developer you will be responsible for the development and maintenance of applications aimed towards iOS and OS X. You will oversee development of applications and their integration with back-end services.  |
|[Objective-C]( https://developer.apple.com/) |Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language and objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. Originally developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s.Objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. It's a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime. |
|[Xamarin]( https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) |Xamarin is a Microsoft-owned open-source framework used for developing native and high-performance Android, iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps leveraging .NET and C# programming languages. The framework empowers businesses to provide native performance and unique user experiences to end-users. In Xamarin, an abstraction layer controls the communication between the underlying platform code and shared code. The framework allows the developers to build an ecosystem with APIs, back-end, components, etc., using tools, libraries, and programming languages supported by an active community.  |


## Cross-platform

| [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)  |  Apache Cordova is a mobile application development framework created by Nitobi.  Cordova wraps your HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing you to easily write one set of code to target nearly every phone or tablet on the market today and publish to their app stores.  |
| [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/)|Aurelia is one of the great and powerful top hybrid mobile app frameworks which allows users to create components using vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. The best framework for hybrid mobile app development, it supports an extensive online community with effortless coding and unmatched extensibility| 
| [Kivy-Python framework](https://kivy.org/#home)  |  Kivy - Open source Python library for rapid development of applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps. Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. You can run the same code on all supported platforms.   |
| [Felgo](https://kivy.org/#home)  |  Felgo is a native cross-platform application development SDK, based on the Qt framework.
